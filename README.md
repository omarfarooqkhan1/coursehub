# CourseHub - A Course Subscription Application

## 📘 Introduction

This project is a prototype ServiceNow application that allows **learners to view and subscribe to courses**. It was built as part of a technical assessment using the **ServiceNow Platform** and **UI Builder**, following best practices in data modeling and client-side logic.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### PRD01: Course List
- Displayed a list of available courses using a Data Resource and Repeater.
- Course details include: **Title**, **Description**, and **Duration**.
- Each course card includes a **Subscribe/Unsubscribe** button based on the learner's current subscription status.

### PRD02: Course Subscription
- When the **Subscribe** button is clicked:
  - User gets a confirmation modal with **Yes/No** buttons
  - When the **Yes** button is clicked:
    - A new record is created in the `Course Subscription` table for the logged in user.
    - UI dynamically changes the Subscibe button based on learner’s existing subscription.
- When the **Unsubscribe** button is clicked:
  - User gets a modal with coming soon mentioned (Not implemented because **Learner** cannot unsubscribe).
- Prevents duplicate subscriptions by conditionally showing **Subscribe** and **Unsubscribe** buttons.

### QA01: Tests
- A Robot Framework test suite was created to test the **Course Subscription** feature.
- ✅ **Given**: Learner can see a list of courses with `Subscribe` button.
- 🎯 **When**: Learner clicks on the `Subscribe` button, and presses `Yes` button in the confirmation modal.
- 🔍 **Then**: The system verifies that the learner has successfully subscribed (button changes to `Unsubscribe`).
- Test suite uses reusable CSS selectors and runs end-to-end from login to course subscription.
- Please refer to `tests/how_to_run.txt` for running the test suite

## 🔐 Learner Login Simulation

- Users can simulate login by typing their name and selecting the account from the dropdown.
- Upon login, the selected learner’s `sys_id` is stored in a **Client State Parameter** (`learnerId`) which is passed to the next page (`/courses`) as a query parameter.
- Redirects to the Course List page with learner context preserved.

## 🚦 Navigation Flow

1. **Login Page**:
   - Select a learner from the dropdown (with search functionality).
   - Click **Login** to save learner ID and redirect.
2. **Course List Page**:

   - Learner interactions update the subscription model accordingly.
